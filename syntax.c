/*
Make a single program in the C language by augmenting and integrating the example C code in Section 4.2
and 4.4.1 on the textbook. The program is supposed to read a text file line by line. For each line, it produces
the output similar to what's shown on Page 178 and 179. If a syntax error is found, it should print an error
message indicating where the error occurs in the line.
The program should be invoked by the following command:
parser <file_name>
Where <file_name> should be replaced by a real file name.

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
	printf("Hello");
	return 0;
